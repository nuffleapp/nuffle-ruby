# Nuffle, The Ruby Library

Nuffle, The Ruby Library, is a simple library that provides the functionality to roll one die with any number of sides.


## Installation

First, install Nuffle using [RubyGems](http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/#installing-gems):

```
gem install nuffle
```

Then, require the library at the top of your script:

```
require 'nuffle'
```

## Usage

Nuffle is a simple dice roller, allowing you to roll a die of any number of sides. To do so, simply call the `roll()` method with the number sided die you want to roll:

```
Nuffle.roll(20)
```

That method will return a number between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
